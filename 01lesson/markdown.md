Note: Welcome to the introductory Python course with Veroskills. My name is Tyler Maxwell, I am a freelance web developer and Python enthusiast. 

This course will require only basic computer literacy i.e. the ability to download files from the internet and basic math and logic skills



## [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Note: Mac and Linux users most likely have Python installed on your computers. I will show you how to check in the next video. Windows users will have to go to python.org and download Python.

## Guido van Rossum

Note: Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido. Programming languages take on the characteristics of a cultural movement and Python is no exception. The community is very welcoming to newcomers. Python has exploded in popularity in recent years.

Note: The name comes from Monty Python, not the snake, although, the snake has become the mascot of sorts.

## Why Python?

<div class="fragment">

```python
print("Hello, World")
```
Note: Python reads like English. Blank spaces are used instead of curly braces. 

</div>

<div class="fragment">

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    puts("Hello, World");
    return 0;
}
```
</div>

Note: I am not speaking negatively about C.
